In response to this story update, on Monday, June 7, 2014 at 5:47pm CDT, the developers of the "Riptide, Tomb Raider" franchise announced that they are currently working on an ambitious and fun-filled game for the PS4 that has been made available to the public for the umpteenth time on Steam for its public preview this March. In a statement released this morning, the developers of The Riptide series stated:


"It's exciting to see the new content will soon be available upon release and to see that we're not alone among developers in making a game that you'll love to play. We're excited by the opportunities for this to be possible so we've worked tirelessly in the past few years to create a truly unique experience. We're incredibly excited about what this new "Riptide, Tomb Raider" multiplayer will bring to the PS4."


As for what the game will entail for the PC, not sure. We'll talk further, hopefully before returning to our comments section.

Riptide will now be available for download on Steam and will release on Xbox One on May 15th to PC and Mac.

Thanks, The Riptide Team!
